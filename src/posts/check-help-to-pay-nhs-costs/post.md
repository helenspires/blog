*“It was a lot of money, I used to have to pick and choose what medications I got, because I just couldn’t afford everything”*


Currently there are several different reasons that would entitle a person to receive free or reduced cost NHS prescriptions, dental care or travel to a hospital appointment.


But there are also a number of barriers to getting this help:
- Lack of awareness of help and how to get it
- Preconceptions of who is entitled
- Getting through the gatekeepers
- Overcoming embarrassment
- The landscape of entitlement is complex

> **Key barrier**: The changing landscape and complexity of the policies makes it confusing for patients to understand what they are entitled to.


## Solutions
A smart questionnaire to show a patient if they are eligible for help, and if so, what they should do next. This may be actions to take at the chemist or directing them to another service.

## Challenges
**48,000 different variables**: There are 92 possible combinations of help available depending on the patients circumstances. This was challenging for the development team to impliment whilst still adhereing to a simple design.

**Government jargon and legal language**: Using plain English is fundimental to the success of a service, yet as a government department we get used to jargon everyday. We worked hard at balancing plain english and the legal teams wishes.

The first reads: Do you get an additional child element or have you been assessed as having limited capability for work? The second reads: Do you get any of these additonal elements of Universal Credit? and the last reads: Does your Universal Credit include either of these payments?](/images/universal-credit-questions.jpg "Content iteration for Universal Credit questioning")

**Multiple government departments as stakeholders**: We worked with 7 different government departments, 6 of which had an active role in how the service would be implimented. (Department for Work and Pensions, Department of Health and Social Care, Ministry of Defence, Home Office, The Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Government Digital Service).
