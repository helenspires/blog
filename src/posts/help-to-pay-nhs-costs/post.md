*“It was a lot of money, I used to have to pick and choose what medications I got, because I just couldn’t afford everything”*

## The problem
Currently a 16 page paper form that is obtained from a GP surgery, dentist or pharmacy. It gets 380,000 applications annually, each processed by a caseworker, and it has nearly a 1 to 1 ratio of calls to applications.

The user groups vary widely, often with volatile incomes and a range of access needs. It is hugely important to get this right.

## Solutions
Currently in private BETA, the service only asks questions relevant to the claimants circumstances based on filter questions. 

We worked **very** hard on alleviating stakeholder fears, and assertaining what information is needed to calculate a claim rather than what has always been asked for.

## Challenges
**Multiple entry points**: To allow multiple entry points into the service, we worked with GDS to get a GOV.UK start page. This is only the second NHS service start page on GOV.UK.

**Huge amount of pages**: To allow for an MVP release, we devised the miniumum amout of questions we could learn from. This quickly grew so that other circumstances could also be accomodated. There are roughtly 200 developed pages.

**1p can change the outcome of a decision**: Many users guess figures, especially pence. 1p in the calculation can mean the difference between getting free prescriptions or not, so it was viatlly important to stress the importance of getting things right.

**Resistance to change**: Fraud is a huge concern for the business, and this fear can hold progress in large scale projects.
