You can [view the GDS pattern for errors on GOVUK elements](https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com).

First thiing to do is to state an error has occurred in the page title. For example:

``` html
<title>Error: Your details</title>
```

There are a few of disclaimers:

- I'm combining figures from reports in 2014, 2016 and 2017. So the results won't be representative of a single historic year. Instead, they will be the most up to date figures I could find.

- The reports will only capture those with a diagnosis. Those with a registered disability. Or, those who took part in research by the Office for National Statistics. It's likely there are more people who have disabilities but are not included in the data.

- Of those people wtih a disability that do use the internet, not all will need to use assistive technology.

- I'm only using UK statistics. People can access websites from anywhere in the world, so the figures will actually be far higher.

```
Working out
63% of 65,648,054 = 41,358,274
18% of 65,648,054 = 11,816,649
41,358,274 + 11,816,649 = 53,174,923
```


That is almost 10 million people in the UK alone are surfing the web with a disability. *Definitely NOT an edge case.*
