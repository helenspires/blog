## The problem
Currently both the midwife and patient has to fill in sections of a controlled form. The patient then has to send the form to the NHS to process. Many women believe that **being** pregnant grants them exemption rather than being in receipt of a Maternity Exemption card.

Often women change names or address, leaving a discrepancy with the data the GP holds for them. This can lead to a fine.

## Solutions
Using common platforms and reusable components to simplify the service and informed consent is obtained by a trusted health professional, means that the mother  does not need to apply. We hope to use GP patient data, so that no more unnecessary fines are issued.

**1p can change the outcome of a decision**: Many users guess figures, especially pence. 1p in the calculation can mean the difference between getting free prescriptions or not, so it was viatlly important to stress the importance of getting things right.

**Resistance to change**: Fraud is a huge concern for the business, and this fear can hold progress in large scale projects.  -->
