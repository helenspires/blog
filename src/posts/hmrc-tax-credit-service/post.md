I worked as part of a team building the Tax credits service. I was responsible for building the prototypes used during user research and development. Prototypes were also presented to stakeholders for sign off.

I used prototypes extensively to demonstrate user journeys and explain design thinking to product managers and other stakeholders.

Prototypes helped the team communicate more efficiently. Helping both frontend and backend developers understand layout and user journeys. A link to a relevant section of a prototype was included in the user stories held in Jira.
